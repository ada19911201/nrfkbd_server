# 部署

从[qmkbuilder](https://github.com/ruiqimao/qmkbuilder)中抽离，需要分别部署客户端和服务端

## 前置

安装`nodejs`

```bash
# use curl to install nvm
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash
# or wget
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash

soure ~/.bashrc
# if you use zsh
soure ~/.zshrc

# install nodejs and npm
nvm install node

# install pm2
sudo npm install -g pm2
```

## 部署后端

```bash
# 源码位置
cd /usr/local/src
# git clone
git clone https://github.com/bubao/keyboard-builder-server.git
# 进入项目文件夹
cd keyboard-builder-server
# 安装依赖
npm install
# 启动服务
pm2 start -n builder npm -- run start
# 查看服务是否正常运行
pm2 status
# 确保pm2 正常运行，才能运行下面的命令启动“开机启动服务”
pm2 save
pm2 startup
```

外网访问

```bash
vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/builder
```

```nginx

# You should look at the following URL's in order to grasp a solid understanding
# of Nginx configuration files in order to fully unleash the power of Nginx.

#
# In most cases, administrators will remove this file from sites-enabled/ and
# leave it as reference inside of sites-available where it will continue to be
# updated by the nginx packaging team.
#
# This file will automatically load configuration files provided by other
# applications, such as Drupal or Wordpress. These applications will be made
# available underneath a path with that package name, such as /drupal8.

# Please see /usr/share/doc/nginx-doc/examples/ for more detailed examples.

	# deny access to .htaccess files, if Apache's document root
	# concurs with nginx's one
	#

#
# You can move that to a different file under sites-available/ and symlink that

git pull
# 如果有新的依赖，就需要 npm install
npm run deploy
```

后端
